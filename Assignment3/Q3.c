 * Assignment 3 - Question 3
 * 
 * This program simulates a parking lot where cars try and find parking spots. 
 * There are 5 parking spaces, and cars will wait for spots if all spots are taken.
 * 
 * We use semaphores to track available parking spots and a mutex to sync the printf
 * to the thread thats outputing info, so that the terminal output looks cleaner.
 * 
 * Note: The mutex is used to stop multiple cars from printing at the same time,
 * so their output doesnâ€™t overlap and to safely update and display the number of 
 * available parking spots without messing up the shared data.
 * 
 * Compile: gcc Q3.c -o q3 -lpthread -lrt
 * Run: ./q3
